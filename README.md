# Car-and-Pedestrian-Detection

This is the program of Car and Pedestrian detection using Haar Cascade Classifier. Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
Here I have worked with vehicle and pedestrian detection. Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of cars and pedestrians) and negative images (images without cars and pedestrians) to train the classifier.

This System has the following Haar Cascades:
  
  1. Haar Cascade for Car detection
  1. Haar Cascade for Pedestrian Detection
  
Also it requires:
  * OpenCV in Python
  * Numpy
  
The Results of the system are as shown below:
